### Guessing Game from Rust Book

This code is produced by following the [tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), if some light modifications.

In the feature I may try to experiment things here as I learn more.

Make sure you have Rust installed, then run: `cargo run`. It will download dependencies, build and run the project
